Board for Scripting Engine
--------------------------

To-Do:

    - Define what a card effect is and the different types of effects

    - Create the functions to interact with the specific fields
    - Create utility functions that do more complex actions from core functions
        - Draw a card, shuffle the deck,
    - Define what a card Ability is, and what effects are a result of abilities
    - Create the Core functions to do simple abstract action in the game for scripters
        - moving a card from zone to zone, get a certain field on a player side, etc.
    -Refactor eventListerners to Guava EventHub
    - Proof of concept the ability template system
    - POTENTIAL ISSUES TO CHECK:
        - [critical] Players might be receiving events out of order
    - Code Interrupt Rule Action System
    - Code Trigger Handling System
    - refactor Game Phase handling (see PhaseHandlingComparison.txt & core Major Components impl.docx))

In-Progress:
    -Change command Format from list of strings to a key-value pair of arguments
        ex: playtiming command:
            - Methodname/commandname
            - arguments
                - object
                - object
            -Meta Arguments?
    - Define all basic commands needed for game completion, assuming no player input and default choices for simple choices. 

Done:
    - Detail STEP-BY-STEP how triggers occur (ex: triggering a level up or reshuffle) (see Trigger System Thoughts.txt)
    - Design how Interrupt Type rule actions affect the overall system, and how to evade their interruptions
        [see InterruptTypeRuleActionThoughts.txt]
    - Create the playing field zones
