In order to make Triggers serializable and have descriptive information we need to look at the follow objects which are deemed "Dynamic Objects"
Any "Dynmaic Object" is an interface which is impossible to get specific fields/information for  against and thus needs to be converted to an abstract class for the purpose of the game.
remember: we're serializing the game. not the API, dont convert things that the game doesnt directly interact with (e.g never serialize papercard, only PlayingCard)
- PlayZone
- LocalizedString


Communication Serialization Process:
	1. All Triggers & data that is sent to the client must implemented a protoSerializable
		ProtoSerializables:
			Generate a GrpcGameMessage 
				Triggers:
					makes it own Grpc Trigger thats included in the OneOf inside a GrpcGameMessage
				PlayChoice:
					Makes its own special OneOf included inside GrpcGameMessage
