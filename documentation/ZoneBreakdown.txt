How do we Interact with a zone?
	- Add
		- By Default add to last index
	- Add Via Index
		- All zones should follow a 0-based index (0 is the first card inserted/bottom of stack)
	- Remove Via Reference
	    - No blind remove or via index, Remova Via Reference guarantees the card is there (what if we tried blind removing stock during paying?)
	- SetIndex
		- used for moving a card within a zone
