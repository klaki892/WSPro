How do we get a trigger to pass the correct Trigger type to Lua?
    Possibility #1: function for what TriggerName Enum to listen to & Seperate function that takes it as a parameter
		1. On JavaSide we create a generic subsciber to base event
			2. on event recieve, call lua function to check if right type
			3. if right type, pass the trigger into another function for actual handling.
		Pros:
			+ Gets around typing problem
		Cons: Untested 
		Neutral: see below for help
