What is the process flow from server start to Game Start
	1. Check Configuration
		a. Test connection to CardFinder and AbilityFinder
		b. Start up other services depending on arguments (e.g. kubernetes = health check)
	2. Start server listening for connections
	3. First connection should give us game configuration details
		a. give us name of players & their deck lists
		b. use configuation to source cards & abilities
		c. Pull from sources all cards & abilities and setup game 
		d. return confirmation of game setup with any warnings or errros(missing cards) 
	4. Await for connections from players (or timeout?)
	5. When player connected
		a. determine identity of player
		b. hook connection into respective controller for game
	6. when both players connected
		a. obtain ready-up flag from each
	7. Start game, await game over.
	8. When game is over
		a. save/log game stats? (and other hooks)
		b. close all connections
	9. end program or stay alive for more games
